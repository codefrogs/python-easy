In this script we have done the following:

1. We have added signal handling.
2. The signal handler closes all the tasks.

So when CTRL-C is typed, we get a graceful shutdown.

But there's one issue we have to explore.

1. Although we have cancelled the tasks we created,
   main() is still running. We want that to gracefully
   shutdown too.
   
We'll see what we can do when main itself is perhaps
blocking on some await function. We'll create the problem
in the next script first.
