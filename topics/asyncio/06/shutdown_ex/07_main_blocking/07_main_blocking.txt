So now we have a single handler, we want to show one possible
problem. We want to see what we can do if our main function is
blocking, in other words awaiting some IO operation.

Try it out:
1. Run the script.
2. Try to CTRL-C to terminate it.

It will cancel the tasks, but then 'wait in main' for 10 seconds
effectively blocking the shutdown.

Remember you can cancel a process with: 'kill -9 <ID>'

Note: We are not trying to solve anything in this script. We
are just demonstrating an issue.

Let's take one step back, and return to one coroutine in the next
script.
