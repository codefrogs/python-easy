Shutdown example 04
-------------------

In this script we cancel all our tasks.
But an exception is thrown: asyncio.exceptions.CancelledError

When we wait on a task that has thrown an exception, it throws the exception!

We could try to catch the exception at the await (at line 45) when we try to retrieve the 
result, but we will instead catch the exception in 'do_calc' which gives the task
the opportunity to finish up.

Will try that out in the next example (05).
