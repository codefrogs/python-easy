README.txt

This is our first step into asyncio.
We are going to use the asyncio 'event loop', and reference it directly.

We should note that the documentation says:

"Application developers should typically use the high-level asyncio functions,
such as asyncio.run(), and should rarely need to reference the loop object
or call its methods."

But we are just exploring and evolving our server here, and this should help
our understanding.
