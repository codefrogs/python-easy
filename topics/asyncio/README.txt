In the examples we gradually develop a prime number server.
Our initial solution just uses sockets. 

Then, we evolve the server so that it uses asyncio and can
handle multiple clients and shutdown gracefully.

Note: This is not production quality code, 
This example is being used to demonstrate various issues
with different approaches to creating the server.
